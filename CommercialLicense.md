# Introduction #

If you wish to derive a commercial advantage by not releasing your application under an open source license, you must purchase an appropriate number of commercial licenses from the gwt-cal team. By purchasing commercial licenses, you are no longer obligated to publish your source code.

The intent of the commercial license is to fund the development of the project, as well as other open source initiatives we support.

# Terms #

Commercial Licenses:
  * Are on a per developer basis. Each person who directly or indirectly creates an application or user interface containing gwt-cal is considered a developer.
  * Are perpetual and **include upgrades** to all major and minor revisions.
  * Are royalty-free.
  * Remove any obligations to release any source code under GPL.
