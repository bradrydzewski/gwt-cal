gwt-cal is a web-based calendar component similar to iCal, Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar. It can be included in any Google Web Toolkit (GWT) web-application, and can be easily themed to resemble your favorite calendar tool.

See live demos of available themes: [iCal](http://ical.latest.gwt-web-calendar.appspot.com/), and [Outlook](http://outlook.latest.gwt-web-calendar.appspot.com/), [Google Calendar](http://google.latest.gwt-web-calendar.appspot.com/).
